Notes about when a user creates an account:
1. Add the new user to users with password and salt
2. Add the new user to leagueInvites with empty leagues field

Some notes about updating the app:

Each round the app will need to:

At the end of the previous round:
-- More now that I have updated all of the databases, will need to update: leagues

1. Refresh the round timer to be the time of the start of the next round (UNRESOLVED: Not Implemented)
2. Web scrape all of the stats from the previous round (SOLVED: With Python and Firestore DB)
3. Web scrape the images of the new players (KIND OF SOLVED: With Python, but still manual due to name misalignments between websites)
4. Update all user stats for the previous round (UNRESOLVED: Not Implemented)
5. Change the 'currentRound' constant in Utils to be the next round (UNRESOLVED: Manual)
6. Update the players to include injuries and new players that will be in the next round(UNRESOLVED)

At the start of the next round:
1. Refresh the round timer to indicate the end of this round (UNRESOLVED)
2. Lock the Pick Players for the round (UNRESOLVED)

Notes about what to implement in the future:

1. Player cost so teams do not consist of only forwards - Pull stats from 2020 and 2021 to calculate cost for each player
2. League Invitations
